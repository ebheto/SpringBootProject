FARM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

Goal

Our aim is to build a basic backend java service using Spring Boot to program an API with CRUD functionality.

The program will perform operations on a MySql database in response to http requests to demonstrate our understanding, and ability to direct, the flow of data in a manner similar to production software.

We will also be demonstrating our wider understanding of software design through detailed project management, effective source control, thorough testing, and appropriate documentation. 

My project is a Farm Management system that allows a user to interact with a database containig a collection of farms. Data fields within the Farm table are Farm_name, address, email & telephone. The application is written in Java and built on Spring Boot, using Maven for dependency management, mySQL as a primary database and H2 for testing.
